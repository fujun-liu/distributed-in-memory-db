This is a simple distributed in memory file system. It has following features:

1. It is a one-level in memory file system

2. It is implemented using FUSE which is a user-space file system

3. It is based on client-server style RPC calls

4. Mutiple servers are supported. So it is claimed distributed

5. The servers are organized in a consistent hashing ring for fault tolerance

6. It is based on class project. So basically just proof of concept.
